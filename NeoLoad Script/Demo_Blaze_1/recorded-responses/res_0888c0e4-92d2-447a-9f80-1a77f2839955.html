                                    Hi All,
&nbsp;
On 30th of April 2019, we will be having a downtime in power at Indian Office due to the installation of new generator. Installation will be started at 2.00 PM. As a technical requirement generator installation engineers has informed that we will have to face 2 ~ 3 hours total loss of power &amp; the generator power for the power outlets. Within this time frame power will be provided with power extension cables. We will be giving power extension so that you could use it to charge the laptops.

Part of HR&rsquo;s job is to meet and communicate with employees and job seekers on a daily basis. But with employees giving weird excuses for being late to work, behaving strangely on business trips, and job seekers doing questionable things to get noticed, how much more can an HR executive handle?
In line with that, OrangeHRM has compiled a list of 14 things that drive HR executives crazy &ndash; and here are 10 of our favourites.
#1 Chasing people to do online training modulesThere&rsquo;s no excuse for not completing a 15 minute safety training within 2 weeks.
#2 Senior executives thinking the rules don&rsquo;t apply to themYour company has a strict dress code for warehouse employees but the senior executives constantly enter the warehouse without protective gear.
#3 Low employee engagement survey turnoutsThe most accurate way to get a reading of the employee engagement is by the survey.
#4 Coming to a professional interview in casual attireHow is the recruiter supposed to take you seriously if you&rsquo;re wearing jeans and yeezys?
#5 Being asked to judge candidates based on things they shouldn&rsquo;t be judged on. Things like attractiveness, number of kids, marital status, nationality, etc. Not only can this be immoral, but illegal as well.
#6 Bringing your family to an interviewDon&rsquo;t even think about bringing your parents to an interview.
#7 HR not being at the executive tableHR is arguably the most important department in the organisation as people are the most important asset an organisation has. You have a CEO, COO, CMO, CTO, CFO, but no CHRO or CPO?
#8 HR are not maidsHaving HR coordinators serve executive lunches is not an appropriate use of their time.
#9 Storing a month&rsquo;s worth of frozen food in the freezer or leaving food to rot in fridgeThe fridge and freezer are for everybody, you should be refilling it everyday.
#10 Junk resumesSome HR execs have reported that over 98% of responses they get from a job board posting is junk. It&rsquo;s either candidates from overseas who are looking to be sponsored, unqualified candidates, robots, or recruiting firms. This issue is become less common as more organisations are starting to use applicant tracking systems or ATS.                                </span>

What is GDPR and when does it take effect?
The General Data Protection Regulation is a piece of EU legislation passed by the European Parliament in 2016.
It is enforceable in all EU countries from May 25, 2018.
Punishing fines for data misuse and breaches can reach &pound;18million or 4 percent of global annual turnover, whichever is higher.
The GDPR aims to make it simpler for people to control how companies use their personal details.
Strict rules mean companies will not be allowed to collect and use personal information without the person's consent.
Data includes things like a person's name, email address and phone number, and also internet browsing habits collected by website cookies.
Firms must also report any data breaches - including cyber attacks and accidental leaks - to authorities within 72 hours.
Individuals can demand a copy of all data held about them, which must be supplied within 30 days.
And in some cases, they can ask for any data to be deleted in a formal "right to be forgotten" law.
Privacy campaigners have hailed the regulation as a new step forward for&nbsp;online rights,&nbsp;but small firms are furious about the burden of complying with the law.
&nbsp;
What does GDPR mean for businesses?
With just over 100 days until the rules came into force, a government study showed only 38 percent of British firms were even aware of GDPR, let alone ready to comply.
Business groups have said companies will have to spend &pound;1.2million each on average to prepare for the complex rules on data processing.
Many do not currently track their data processing in a way that complies with the new rules.
And if they have sought consent from customers to collect data, often the records are out of date or the consents do not meet the GDPR standards.
Facebook and Google are among the firms likely to be most affected by the changes.
They make money from people's data by using it to target advertising at their interests.
Retailers, insurers, and banks are also likely to have to make the biggest changes to ensure they comply.
In January 2018 Facebook published a post detailing its "privacy principles" for the first time.
Erin Egan, Chief Privacy Officer at Facebook, said that the principles "guide our work" and the company wants to give users "more control of your privacy".
The guidelines state: "We recognize that people use Facebook to connect, but not everyone wants to share everything with everyone &ndash; including with us."
Users in EU countries will get video guides in their newsfeeds teaching them how to control their privacy and advertising settings.
Critics said the social media giant - with two billion users - had been forced into the move by GDPR and the guidelines "crib large chunks" of the EU regulation.
Small businesses and charity fundraisers face a major headache as most do not have the resources or expertise to make sure they comply with the new rules.
