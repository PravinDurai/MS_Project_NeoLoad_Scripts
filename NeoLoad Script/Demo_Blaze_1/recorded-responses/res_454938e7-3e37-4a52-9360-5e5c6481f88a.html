                                Workplace safety procedures are designed to keep employees, visitors and customers safe while helping to reduce the stress associated with the work area. Company management should take the time to develop safety procedures at work, that get the entire staff involved in making company safety a&nbsp;priority. Following are the key components of a safety procedure.
&nbsp;
Reporting Process&nbsp;
When employees see potential safety problems, they should be trained to avoid trying to handle the problems on their own. Employees should be aware of the safety reporting process, and should report safety issues immediately. For an example, if any employee encounters an emergency situation like a fire hazard they should immediately report the incident to responsible parties such like fire marshals.
&nbsp;
Evacuation
When an emergency happens within the organization, such as a fire or explosion, it is important for everyone in the company to know the evacuation procedure. The closest emergency exit to each department should be pointed out and be developed a set of procedures for the safe evacuation of the building. Those procedures would include what personal items to bring, when should evacuate, the route each person should take and how to report to a member of the management team once an employee is outside the building. Evacuation maps should be posted throughout the building, and emergency exits should check regularly to make sure they remain accessible.
&nbsp;
Safety Training
Training is necessary, so that employees will know how to practice safety in the workplace. Depending on the type of equipment used, the training may be required by a federal mandate. Training can come from outside experts hired to conduct awareness sessions or employees specially trained to perform safety instruction. First Aid Kit&nbsp;Well-stocked first aid kits should be a part of any company safety program. A first aid kit should contain sterilized bandages, medical adhesive tape, antibacterial ointment, surgical gauze, headache and over-the-counter pain medication.

                                In the context of computer security, Social Engineering refers to psychological manipulation of people into sharing sensitive information, or performing actions. Social Engineers are smart enough to extract important information about people, from what they post on online and to persuade victims to share their sensitive information.
&nbsp;
Over-sharing Online
&nbsp;
Even the information you posted online seems to be harmless, that information will be a treasure-trove to social engineers (Hackers). By gathering information from different sources as small pieces, Cyber criminals are capable enough to come up with enough information to craft a very convincing social engineering scam.
You may post a picture of your pets,picture of your car, etc on the internet. Yes it seems harmless,there is no sensitive data about you (victim). But pet&rsquo;s name and color of the car, these are very common security questions. Oh dude,you are done, you have already exposed your sensitive data.
&nbsp;
Persuasion Scams
Malicious actors use information posted on social media websites by a travelling family member to trick other family members into sending money overseas. Often the scam targets the elderly, who are less likely to realize the information was originally posted online.The scammers rely on all the information which is posted online by the victim, to build the trust convince the family member that they know the traveller. Following are very common travel scam examples;

&nbsp;
Tech Support Call Scams
&nbsp;

Here, Scammer pretends as a well known IT support company and convince victim that the victim's computer has been hacked.Also scammer pretend to know everything about victim's computer, how it got hacked and many other details that help them gain victim's trust and convince the victim to fall prey for their scams. By convincing the victim, Scammer usually persuade victim to provide remote access to the victim's computer.
&nbsp;
&nbsp;Romance Scams
 Scammers create fake profiles on online dating sites (or apps) and they establish relationships with the other site members with the intention of finding a victim. Once a sense f trust between two parties has reached to a significant level, Scammers start to use that trust in unethical ways (eg:- asking for financial assistance and they will not pay back). Refer the real world examples listed below,

A woman lost &pound;1.6 million
A Perth woman has lost $300,000
US woman lost her $50.000 life savings

                                Hi All,
How do you create a set of service standards?
There are at least seven potential sources of information to help define the service standards for an organization: 

management
employees
existing customers
potential customers
lost or former customers
competitors
regulatory authorities
Management&nbsp;

                                Hi All,
Our global meeting forecasts the increasing strategic role and value that meeting and event play in organization.
In the 2017 forecast, we see a shift in sentiment, reflecting both continued global expansion and growth, balanced by political and economic uncertainty. Our survey respondents have indicated overarching program spend will likely be similar to 2016, but overall activity, including number of meetings or number of attendees per meeting, may see a decline. We&rsquo;re seeing several trends in different regions of the world, which we&rsquo;ll dive into below.

                                Hi All,
Goals and Objectives Checklist If you're having trouble deciding what your goals and objectives are, here are some questions to ask yourself:

How determined am I to see this succeed?
Am I willing to invest my own money and work long hours for no pay, sacrificing personal time and lifestyle, maybe for years?
What's going to happen to me if this venture doesn't work out?
If it does succeed, how many employees will this company eventually have?
What will be its annual revenues in a year? Five years?
What will be its market share in that time frame?
Will it be a niche marketer, or will it sell a broad spectrum of good and services?
What are my plans for geographic expansion? Local? National? Global?
Am I going to be a hands-on manager, or will I delegate a large proportion of tasks to others?
If I delegate, what sorts of tasks will I share? Sales? Technical? Others?
How comfortable am I taking direction from others? Could I work with partners or investors who demand input into the company's management?
Is it going to remain independent and privately owned, or will it eventually be acquired or go public?

Global Team                                 </span>

                                Hi All,
The steps required for individual transactions in the accounting process are:
Identify the transaction. First, determine what kind of transaction it may be. Examples are buying goods from suppliers, selling products to customers, paying employees, and recording the receipt of cash from customers.Prepare document. There is frequently a business document to be prepared or recognized to initiate the transaction, such as an invoice to a customer or an invoice from a supplier.

Identify accounts. Every business transaction is recorded in an account in the accounting database, such as a revenue, expense, asset, liability, or
&nbsp;
 stockholders' equity account. Identify which accounts are to be used to record the transaction.Record the transaction. Enter the transaction in the accounting system. This is done either with a journal entry or an on-line standard transaction form (such as is used to record cash receipts against open accounts receivable). In the latter case, the transaction forms record information in a pre-determined set of accounts.
